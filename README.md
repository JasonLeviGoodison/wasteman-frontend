Aimed at raising money for climate change, we partnered with 4 charities in (Forest, Ocean, Air, Coral reef). Each amingo has a background that represents a destroyed eco system and after you purchase one, we donate a portion of that on your behalf and clean that background, we clean that background for you.


# All the normal NFT PFP fun!

There are 7 base Amingos with varying rarity and over 1 million unique combinations of possible accessories
